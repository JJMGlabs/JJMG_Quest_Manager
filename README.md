# JJMG Quest Manager

The JJMG Quest Manager is a system of allowing an application to track player quest or task progression normally found in a game (sometimes called an RPG system). The system uses games as its primary focus but was designed with simulations in mind. The project is currently a work in progress but is well on its way to achieving its main goals which are as follows:

- The Manager will allow developers or if required end users to create questlines inside an intuitive GUI
- The quest system can be plugged into a game and immediately offer most conventional forms of quest progression like linier, branching or even singular quests
- The quest system will be compatible with most game engines or frameworks as a DLL e.g., Unity, Unreal, Godot
- The Quest Manager will support various progression tracking options allowing (or restricting from) scenarios such as players creating quests, multiplayer games, online hosting or educational/business use.

Aside from these goals the quest manager is essentially the same as similar systems which are available currently offering the ability to create game quests and have players progress through them. There is some work to be completed to make the project usable in full scale applications which includes.
-	Cleanup of the UI with some more user experience consideration
-	A significant body of documentation is needed to explain the code
-	The existing quest manager code needs to be completed and some examples of plugging into projects provided
-	Documentation needs to be provided to explain some of the design choices that went into creating the manager in the way it has been done so far
-	It is intended to extend the projects offered in the UI to include an Inventory and Player levelling system
This readme will eventually be update as progress towards these initial goals is completed and more documentation is moved into a wiki.
